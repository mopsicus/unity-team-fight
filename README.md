# unity-team-fight
Simple game example to show how to make team fight between two teams on limited field with pathfinding.

All units starts from random positions with random team players count. And action begin: each of them scans field like sonar waves for find enemy, and after, build path to it, start moves to it. If enemy oppears near unit, they will attack each other with random damage. When one of them die, winner start new search for new target. 

## Features
1. Small DC count
2. Small/zero memory alloc, only on start
3. Pathfinding
4. Stylized UFO wars :)
